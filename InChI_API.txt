InChI Library with API and test applications
============================================
cInChI-1 Software version 1.01 source code
============================================

INCHI_API     contains code, VC++ 6.0 projects and gcc makefile of
=========     InChI generation library with API Win32 dll
              (inchilib.dll) and testing executable INCHI_MAIN.exe
              that calls inchilib.dll.

INCHI_API/INCHI_DLL     contains InChI generating code (libinchi.so
                        or libinchi.dll library source code)

INCHI_API/INCHI_MAIN    contains ANSI-C testing application source
                        code to call InChI library libinchi.
              It can read Mol/SDfiles and InChI output.
              It produces either 0D or 2D/3D stereochemical input
              for the InChI generating code library depending on
              whether CREATE_0D_PARITIES is defined in e_ichimain.c.
                Defining MAKE_INCHI_FROM_AUXINFO in e_ichimain.c makes it
              feed InChI library with Aux_Info produced by InChI library,
              convert it into InChI library input format, produce new
              InChI, and compare it to the InChI created from the
              original structure.
                Please notice that /D "INCHI_LINK_AS_DLL" Visual C ++
              compiler option is necessary to create and link the dll
              and the testing executable with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
              or .NET under Win32.

INCHI_API/gcc_so_makefile contains a gcc makefile for
                          INCHI_MAIN + INCHI_DLL code to create
              InChI library as a shared object or dll dynamically
              linked to the main program
              The makefile is designed to be run by make from this
              directory. The i386 Linux executables produced by
              this makefile, libinchi.so.1.00.00.gz and main_inchi.gz,
              are located in the directory INCHI_API/gcc_so_makefile/result
              This directory must exist at the time the makefile is run.

INCHI_API/gcc_makefile  contains a gcc makefile for
                        INCHI_MAIN + INCHI_DLL code to create
              a single  statically linked executable under Win32,
              Linux, or other operating systems.
              It is designed to be run by make from this directory.

RunINCHI_VB6  contains a MS Visual Basic 6 example.
============  It has a simple Mol/SDfile reader and shows how to call
              InChI library dll from a MS Visual Basic 6 application.
              In case of problems displaying RunINCHI window please
              read the included readme.txt file

cInChI        contains source code, VC++ 6.0 project, gcc makefile,
=========     and Win32 executables cInChI-1.exe without CML support.

              File cInChI-1.gz contains Linux i386 executable
              created with the included makefile.
             
              Source code files in InChI/common are same as some
              of the files in the InChI_API/INCHI_DLL and
              InChI_API/INCHI_MAIN directories.

Executable creation

Win32 i386 executables were built with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 SP6
under Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 computer.

Linux i386 executables were built with gcc version 4.1.0 20060304
(Red Hat 4.1.0-3) with glibc-2.4-4 and glibc-kernheaders-3.0-5.2
under Fedora Core 5.

Executable locations:

-- InChI dll + C testing application (Win32)
INCHI_API/vc6_INCHI_DLL/Release/INCHI_MAIN.exe -- testing application
INCHI_API/vc6_INCHI_DLL/Release/inchilib.dll   -- INCHI dll with API

-- Visual Basic Example (Win32)
RunINCHI_VB6/RunINCHI.exe   -- testing application
RunINCHI_VB6/inchilib.dll   -- INCHI dll with API

-- cInChI-1.exe  (Win32)
cInChI/vc6_project/Release/cInChI-1.exe -- InChI console
                                           application with GUI.
-- cInChI-1      (i386 Linux)
cInChI/gcc_makefile/cInChI-1.gz -- Contains cInChI-1
                                   for i386 Linux, no GUI.

-- libinchi.so.1.01.00 and main_inchi (i386 Linux)
INCHI_API/gcc_so_makefile/result/libinchi.so.1.01.00.gz - shared object
INCHI_API/gcc_so_makefile/result/main_inchi.gz          - its testing
                                                          application

The InChI API description is located in inchi_api.h
The InChI library does not provide any support for graphic
user interface (GUI). It is not designed to work in
a multithreaded environment and should be called from
only one thread at a time.

The cInChI-1.exe executable in the cInChI/vc6_project/Release
directory is InChI Win32 console application with GUI.
It produces exactly same identifiers as the InChI library.
To turn on the graphic output use option /d. To display
multicomponent structure results use option /dcr.
To display identical components use /equ or /equnoniso
(non-isotopic comparison).

Under other than Windows operation systems or other than Microsoft
compilers the options should be preceded by "-" instead of "/".

All source code and makefiles have MS-DOS type line separators,
CarriageReturn/Linefeed, or 0x0D 0x0A.
